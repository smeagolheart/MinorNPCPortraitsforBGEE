# MinorNPCPortraitsforBGEE
This mod adds small portraits to speaking NPCs in BG:EE including the Siege of Dragonspear expansion.  
The big world of Baldur's Gate gets even more beautiful!  The goal of this mod is to add small portraits 
to nearly all speaking NPC in the game.  

If any of the portraits are not to your satisfaction due to quality or you feel that the portrait does not
match the in game NPC, report that as well for potential inclusion in future updates.  You will have to 
start a new game to get the portraits on NPCs you've already met in game although future NPCs should have their
portraits.  This mod patches over 600 creatures, future updates from Beamdog may require reinstallation of the mod if
it modifies any of those characters.  Basically, if there is an update to the game, it's probably a good idea to reinstall this mod.
Due to the nature of the way the Infinity Engine handles things, if you install this mod on a game in progress, 
when you go to unvisited maps you will see the new NPC faces while NPCs you met previously will not be affected 
until your next game.

Sources of the pictures include Neverwinter Nights portraits found online, searches for baldur's gate and IWD portraits,
The Super Ultimate Portrait Pack (http://www.moddb.com/games/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/addons/super-ultimate-portrait-pack),
 and as a last resort I used search engines to round out the collection.   
 
Baldur's Gate prior to the EE editions had mods that included small portraits for some NPCs.   The pictures in these mods are lower 
resolution than the ones carefully selected for this mod.  Some of these older mods for classic Baldur's Gate with smaller pictures 
that directly inspired this project are:
Gerri's BGT NPC Portraits ( https://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/downloads.php?id=69 )
BG1NPC ( http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg1npc/ )


If there are any particular portraits that need to be removed you don't wish them to be featured in this work, 
let me know and the pictures will be removed. If you have any suggestions for submissions or changes, please feel free to comment 
in the discussion forum.

If there are any copyright issues or this statement needs revision then please contact me to let me know what to do

the addition of something new onto a great game. 

Special thanks to bob_veng on the baldur's gate.com forums for assistance recoloring, adjusting, selecting and creating new portraits 
for this mod.

Thank you all and enjoy,
